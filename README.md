## Part 1 — The AI Revolution & The Future of Work

We are in the midst of a profound shift driven by **two forms of artificial intelligence**:

* **Generative AI — The creative engine.**

  * Focus: generating new, original content (text, code, images, data analysis).
  * Use cases: brainstorming, drafting, prototyping, and production.

* **Agentic AI — The executor.**

  * Focus: autonomously understanding goals, planning, and executing multi-step tasks.
  * Use cases: automation of workflows, independent task orchestration, proactive collaboration.

> **Key idea:** This wave reshapes the job market — not as human replacement but as **human augmentation**. Those who thrive will learn to leverage AI as a partner to amplify intelligence, creativity, and efficiency.

## Part 2 — The Rise of the AI Generalist

In an AI-first world, the highest-impact role becomes the **AI Generalist** — a versatile, full-stack problem solver who translates AI capability into business value.

**What an AI Generalist does:**

* Applies the right AI tools to solve complex problems.
* Connects technical possibilities to real-world outcomes.

**Key traits of an AI Generalist:**

* **Broad AI Model Knowledge:** Familiarity with different model families and strengths.
* **Strategic Application:** Knows which tool fits a problem for best efficiency and quality.
* **Solution-Oriented Mindset:** Focuses on measurable results and deliverables.
* **Cross-Disciplinary Expertise:** Comfortable across Data, Technology, Product, Design, Marketing, and Management.

## Part 3 — Your Mastermind Roadmap to Becoming an AI Generalist

This two-day mastermind is structured as a five-level progression:

1. **Level 1 — The Foundations (Session 1 focus)**

   * Master expert prompting and assemble a personal toolkit of high-utility AI applications.

2. **Level 2 — The Workflow Architect**

   * Design sophisticated prompting systems and chain tools into automated workflows for multi-step challenges.

3. **Level 3 — The Creator's Playground**

   * Explore multimodal generative AI for creative and content-generation tasks across media.

4. **Level 4 — The Agent Builder**

   * Build, deploy, and manage autonomous AI agents that can think, act, and massively amplify productivity.

5. **Level 5 — The Vibe Coder**

   * Use no-code platforms combined with AI to architect and launch full-stack solutions without writing code.

## Part 4 — Core Skill: Mastering Prompt Engineering

**Premise:** The quality of an AI's output mirrors the quality of your input. A well-structured prompt unlocks better, more relevant results.

### The Magic Prompt Formula (4 parts)

1. **Role** — Define the AI’s persona (e.g., *"You are a seasoned marketing strategist specializing in B2B SaaS."*).
2. **Task** — State the objective clearly (e.g., *"Develop a three-month content marketing plan."*).
3. **Instruction** — Give constraints: format, length, audience, required points, exclusions.
4. **Data** — Provide context (competitor analysis, product details, customer feedback).

### Advanced Prompting Techniques

* **Zero-Shot Prompting:** Direct request without examples.
* **Few-Shot Prompting:** Provide sample input/output to guide format.
* **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** Ask the model to *"think step-by-step"* to improve reasoning.
* **Self-Refine:** Ask the model to review and iteratively improve its own output.
